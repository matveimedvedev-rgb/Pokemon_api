## Project Description
Poken Casino is a simple and fun game where the player selects a Pokémon to battle against the casino’s randomly chosen Pokémon. The outcome of each battle is determined by comparing the Pokémon’s base stats, and points are awarded to the winner.

## Problem Statement
Poken Casino is a game that combines the excitement of Pokémon battles with the unpredictability of casino play. Players choose a Pokémon to face off against the casino’s randomly selected Pokémon, and the winner is determined by comparing their base stats. The project aims to create an engaging, fair, and easy-to-play game that blends strategy and luck.
